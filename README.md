# .dotfiles

These are my dotfiles. There are many others like it, but these are mine. My dotfiles are my best friend. They are my life. I must master them as I must master my life. Without me, my dotfiles are useless. Without my dotfiles, I am useless.

Heavily inspired and plagerised from the dotfiles [Ben Orenstein](https://github.com/r00k/dotfiles) provides.

## Installation

`git clone git@github.com:bangline/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles`

And `bundle` and `rake install`.
